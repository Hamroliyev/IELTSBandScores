# IELTS Band Scores: How they are calculated

The IELTS band score tables below explain the scoring to help you calculate and 
understand your score. Understanding the requirements for your target score is
essential for success in IELTS.

# How the IELTS Band Scores are Calculated

All IELTS scores are between 0 and 9. You can also get .5 scores as well (for
example, 6.5 or 7.5). You will get a band score for each skill(listening, reading, 
writing, and speaking) and also an overall band score. The overall band score is the 
average band score of all skills. See the table below for an example.

As explained on the IELTS website, overall test results are calculated to the nearest
0.5 or the nearest whole band score. This means if the final score is not a precise 7.5(as
shown in the table above), your score is pushed to the nearest whole score or half 
score depending on which is nearest. Below you can see an example of how this works
according to the IELTS: 

  - If your overall score is 6.1, your score will go down to 6. This is the nearest 
  band score. In other words, 6.1 is closer to band 6 than to band 6.5.
  - If your overall score is calculated to be 6.85, your final result will be band 7.
  This is because 6.85 is closer to band 7 than to band 6.5.
  - If your overall score is an average of 6.25, your score will be increased to 6.5.
  The score 6.25 is actually precisely between band 6 and 6.5, so in this case 
  IELST pushes it up to the nearest score which is 6.5.
  - If your overall score is an average of 6.75, your score will be increased to 7.
  The score 6.25 is actually precisely between bands 6.5 and 7. In this case, your score
  will be rounded up to band 7.
  - As you can see above, your score is rounded up or down to the nearest 0.5 or 
  the whole score as shown above. You can confirm this information on the official
